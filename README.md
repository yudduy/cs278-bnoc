## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+) and npm
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Firebase account and project

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bnoc.git
   cd bnoc
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:
   ```
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   ```

4. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Authentication with Google sign-in
   - Create a Firestore database
   - Set up Firebase Storage
   - Deploy the Cloud Functions (see below)

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

### Setting up Firebase Cloud Functions

1. Navigate to the functions directory:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the functions:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

## üß™ Test Data Setup

For development, you can populate your Firebase with test data:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   node setupFirebaseTestData.js
   ```

This will create test users, pairings, and feed entries in your Firebase project.

## üì± App Structure

The app follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Screens and UI components
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contexts, hooks, and service interfaces
3. **Data Access Layer**: Firebase services and local storage

Key components include:

- **Context Providers**: `AuthContext`, `PairingContext`, `NotificationContext`
- **Custom Hooks**: `useAuth`, `usePairing`, `useCamera`, `useFeed`
- **Firebase Services**: Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions

## üõ£Ô∏è App Flow

1. **Authentication**: Users sign in with their Stanford email
2. **Daily Pairing**: At 5am PT, users are paired with a new person
3. **Selfie Exchange**: Each user takes a selfie to complete the pairing
4. **Feed Updates**: Completed pairings appear in user and global feeds
5. **Social Interaction**: Users can like and comment on pairings
