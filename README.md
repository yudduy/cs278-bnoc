# BNOC - Daily Meetup Selfie App

BNOC (Be Nice Or Consequences) is a social mobile application designed for daily selfie exchanges between pairs of users. Similar to BeReal, it encourages authentic social connections through time-limited photo exchanges.

## Overview

The app randomly pairs users daily, requiring them to take and share selfies with their partners. After both users submit their photos, the completed pairing is visible in the global feed (if set to public) and in each user's personal feed.

## Core Features

- **Daily Pairings**: Users are randomly paired each day to exchange selfies
- **Photo Sharing**: Simple camera interface for capturing and sharing selfies
- **Feed System**: Personal and global feeds to view completed pairings
- **Friend System**: Add friends to increase chances of being paired with connections
- **Reminders**: Notification system to remind users to complete their pairings
- **Chat**: In-app messaging between paired users

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model

The app uses Firebase Firestore with the following key collections:

- **users**: User profiles and authentication information
- **pairings**: Daily pairing records with photo submissions
- **globalFeed**: Public completed pairings
- **notifications**: User notification records
- **comments**: Comments on pairings

### Recent Improvements

#### 1. Firebase Integration

- Replaced all mock data with real Firebase Firestore data
- Implemented Firebase Storage for photo uploads
- Added batch operations for atomic writes across multiple documents
- Added retry logic for handling WebChannelConnection RPC errors

#### 2. Pairing System Enhancements

- Improved `getCurrentPairing()` with better validation and error handling
- Enhanced `updatePairingWithPhoto()` to track submission status properly
- Added "waiting for partner" state with clear UI feedback
- Implemented robust notification flow between paired users
- Added proper completion flow that publishes to global feed

#### 3. Feed System

- Optimized `getFeed()` and `getGlobalFeed()` with batch fetching
- Implemented `publishPairingToFeed()` for consistent feed publishing
- Added proper tracking of likes and comments
- Improved pagination performance

#### 4. User Connections

- Enhanced `updateConnection()` to handle mutual connections with atomic batch operations
- Added proper connection count tracking
- Updated `getAllUsers()` to fetch real users for the "Add Friends" feature
- Implemented efficient friend search with proper indexing

#### 5. Notification System

- Fully implemented push notification system with Expo Notifications
- Added various notification types (pairing, reminder, completion, social)
- Implemented partner reminders in the pairing context
- Added local notification scheduling capability

#### 6. UI/UX Improvements

- Replaced React Native's Image with Expo Image for better caching
- Enhanced profile screens with real user data and pairing history
- Added loading states and error handling throughout the app
- Implemented user statistics for profiles

## Architecture

The app follows a service-oriented architecture with:

- **Context Providers**: Auth, Pairing, and UI contexts for state management
- **Service Layer**: Firebase, Pairing, User, Feed, and Notification services
- **UI Layer**: Screen components with React Navigation
- **Types**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions

## Firebase Security

- Rules ensure users can only read/write their own data
- Global feed entries only allow reads from authenticated users
- Storage rules restrict uploads to authorized users
- Batch operations maintain data consistency

## Future Improvements

- Implement real-time updates with Firestore listeners
- Enhance feed filtering options
- Improve notification delivery tracking
- Add in-app notification center
- Extend chat functionality with image sharing

## üìã Documentation

The project includes comprehensive documentation:

- [**Architecture Guide**](./doc/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Overview of system design, patterns, and data flow
- [**Development Guide**](./doc/DEVELOPMENT.md) - Current status, coding standards, and next steps
- [**Firebase Guide**](./doc/FIREBASE.md) - Database schema, security rules, and Cloud Functions

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+) and npm
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Firebase account and project

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bnoc.git
   cd bnoc
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:
   ```
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   ```

4. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Authentication with Google sign-in
   - Create a Firestore database
   - Set up Firebase Storage
   - Deploy the Cloud Functions (see below)

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

### Setting up Firebase Cloud Functions

1. Navigate to the functions directory:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the functions:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

## üß™ Test Data Setup

For development, you can populate your Firebase with test data:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   node setupFirebaseTestData.js
   ```

This will create test users, pairings, and feed entries in your Firebase project.

## üì± App Structure

The app follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Screens and UI components
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contexts, hooks, and service interfaces
3. **Data Access Layer**: Firebase services and local storage

Key components include:

- **Context Providers**: `AuthContext`, `PairingContext`, `NotificationContext`
- **Custom Hooks**: `useAuth`, `usePairing`, `useCamera`, `useFeed`
- **Firebase Services**: Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions

## üõ£Ô∏è App Flow

1. **Authentication**: Users sign in with their Stanford email
2. **Daily Pairing**: At 5am PT, users are paired with a new person
3. **Selfie Exchange**: Each user takes a selfie to complete the pairing
4. **Feed Updates**: Completed pairings appear in user and global feeds
5. **Social Interaction**: Users can like and comment on pairings
