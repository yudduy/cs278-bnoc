### Recent Progress (Related to Camera Refactor & Dual Image Flow)
1.  Re-refactored camera system to use `expo-camera` (`CameraView`).
    *   Updated `useCamera.ts` hook.
    *   Updated `CameraCapture.tsx` component.
    *   Verified `CameraPreview.tsx` component.
    *   Updated `CameraScreen.tsx` orchestration.
2.  Refactored `PairingService.updatePairingWithPhoto` to support dual image submissions:
    *   Accepts `userId` to identify submitter.
    *   Updates `user1_photoURL`/`user2_photoURL` and `user1_submittedAt`/`user2_submittedAt`.
    *   Sets pairing status to `user1_submitted`, `user2_submitted`, or `completed` (with `completedAt`).
3.  Updated `firebaseService.ts` facade to correctly call the modified `PairingService` function.
4.  Updated `CameraScreen.tsx` to pass `userId` for pairing update.
5.  Reviewed `Pairing` type in `types/index.ts`; it supports dual image fields (`user1_photoURL`, etc.).
6.  Reviewed `PairingPostCard.tsx`; it already supports displaying two images.
7.  Created `scripts/setupFirebaseTestData.js` to populate Firebase with users and test pairings.
8.  Added `scripts/README.md` for the test data setup script.

## Next Steps
Based on our findings, the app is mostly implemented with a few remaining tasks:

1. ✅ Complete the BlockedUsers management screen
2. Implement Google authentication with Stanford email validation
3. Connect the UI components to the real pairing context
4. Test all features and fix any bugs, including the new single camera flow
5. Clean up Firebase service implementation with real database calls
6. ✅ Update setup instructions and prepare for deployment
1. Implement Firebase Authentication (sign-in for test users).
2. Create UI to access an active pairing and navigate to `CameraScreen` with `pairingId`.
3. Thoroughly test the end-to-end photo capture and submission flow for both users in a pair.
4. Verify and update `ProfileScreen` for pairing history display.
