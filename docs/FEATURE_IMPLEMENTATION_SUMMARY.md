      updateLocalState(snapshot.data());
    },
    (error) => {

## Issue Resolution: Infinite Loop Bug Fix (Real-time Pairing Completion)

### Problem Description
When a pairing was completed and published to the feed, users experienced a repeating loop of "pairing completed" alerts and navigation attempts. This prevented users from using the app normally after pairing completion.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by real-time Firebase listeners continuously detecting the same pairing completion event:

1. **WaitingScreen.tsx**: `onSnapshot` listener detected pairing completion
2. **Alert shown**: "Pairing Completed! ðŸŽ‰" dialog appeared
3. **Navigation triggered**: App navigated to feed
4. **Listener still active**: The Firebase listener continued to fire for the same completion
5. **Infinite loop**: Steps 2-4 repeated endlessly

Similar issues occurred in:
- **CurrentPairingScreen.tsx**: Repeated feed refreshes on same completion
- **DailyPairingScreen.tsx**: Potential repeated state updates

### Solution Implementation

#### 1. **Completion Tracking State**
Added `hasHandledCompletion` state to prevent duplicate handling:

```typescript
// In all affected screens
const [hasHandledCompletion, setHasHandledCompletion] = useState(false);
```

#### 2. **WaitingScreen.tsx Fixes**
```typescript
// Only handle completion once per pairing
if (bothPhotosSubmitted && isPairingCompleted && !hasHandledCompletion) {
  console.log('DEBUG: WaitingScreen - Both photos submitted, redirecting to feed');
  
  // Show success message and navigate
  Alert.alert(/* ... */);
  setHasHandledCompletion(true); // Prevent future triggers
}

// Reset tracking when pairingId changes
useEffect(() => {
  setHasHandledCompletion(false);
}, [pairingId]);
```

#### 3. **CurrentPairingScreen.tsx Fixes**
```typescript
// Real-time listener - only refresh feed once
if (updatedPairing.status === 'completed' && 
    updatedPairing.user1_photoURL && 
    updatedPairing.user2_photoURL && 
    !hasHandledCompletion) {
  setHasHandledCompletion(true);
  await refreshFeed();
}

// Manual mode - only refresh feed once
if (currentPairing.status === 'completed' && !hasHandledCompletion) {
  setHasHandledCompletion(true);
  refreshFeed();
}

// Reset tracking when pairing changes
useEffect(() => {
  setHasHandledCompletion(false);
}, [currentPairing?.id]);
```

#### 4. **DailyPairingScreen.tsx Fixes**
```typescript
// Added completion tracking state and reset logic
const [hasHandledCompletion, setHasHandledCompletion] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setHasHandledCompletion(false);
}, [currentPairing?.id]);
```

### Key Features of the Fix

1. **One-time Execution**: Completion handling only occurs once per pairing
2. **Pairing-specific Tracking**: Resets when moving to a new pairing
3. **Firebase Listener Persistence**: Listeners remain active for future updates
4. **Graceful State Management**: No disruption to real-time functionality
5. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring

### Testing Verification

The fix ensures:
- âœ… Completion alert shows only once
- âœ… Navigation to feed happens only once  
- âœ… Real-time listeners continue working for new pairings
- âœ… No infinite loops or repeated actions
- âœ… Normal app functionality restored after completion

### Technical Impact

- **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary repeated API calls and state updates
- **User Experience**: Removes frustrating infinite loop blocking app usage
- **Reliability**: Ensures predictable completion flow
- **Maintainability**: Clear state tracking pattern for future features

This fix resolves the critical bug that was preventing users from normally using the app after pairing completion, while preserving all real-time functionality and user experience improvements.

## Issue Resolution: Feed Real-Time Update Conflict

### Problem Description
After implementing real-time updates for pairing completion, the feed page was not updating in real-time when pairings completed, even though the Today page was updating correctly.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **conflicting real-time listener systems**:

1. **FeedContext**: Had its own comprehensive real-time listener that monitored all completed pairings
2. **FeedScreen**: Had a separate, redundant real-time listener system
3. **Data Conflict**: Both systems were trying to manage the same feed data, causing conflicts
4. **Missed Updates**: The FeedScreen's local listeners were overriding the FeedContext's updates

This created a situation where:
- FeedContext detected new completions correctly
- FeedScreen had its own conflicting state management
- Updates from FeedContext were ignored by FeedScreen
- Only the Today page (which used simple pairing-specific listeners) worked correctly

### Solution Implementation

#### 1. **Simplified FeedScreen Architecture**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Conflicting dual listener system
const [pairings, setPairings] = useState<Pairing[]>([]);
const [users, setUsers] = useState<Record<string, User>>({});
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
// ... separate Firebase listeners in FeedScreen

// AFTER: Single source of truth from FeedContext
const { 
  pairings, 
  users, 
  loading, 
  refreshing, 
  loadingMore, 
  error, 
  pagination,
  loadFeed,
  loadMoreFeed,
  refreshFeed,
  clearError 
} = useFeed();
```

#### 2. **Removed Duplicate Listener Management**
- âœ… Removed `setupFeedListener()` from FeedScreen
- âœ… Removed `feedListener` refs and cleanup logic
- âœ… Removed duplicate state management (`setPairings`, `setUsers`, etc.)
- âœ… Simplified refresh logic to use FeedContext methods only

#### 3. **Streamlined Pull-to-Refresh**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Complex conditional refresh logic
if (useRealtimeListener) {
  // Clean up and reset listeners
  if (feedListener.current) {
    feedListener.current();
    feedListener.current = null;
  }
  await setupFeedListener();
} else {
  await loadFeed(true);
}

// AFTER: Simple FeedContext refresh
const handleRefresh = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!refreshing) {
    await Promise.all([
      refreshFeed(),
      loadCurrentPairing()
    ]);
  }
}, [refreshing, refreshFeed, loadCurrentPairing]);
```

### Key Benefits of the Fix

1. **Single Source of Truth**: FeedContext is now the only system managing feed data
2. **Consistent Real-Time Updates**: All feed updates go through one system
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed 200+ lines of duplicate code
4. **Better Performance**: No conflicting listeners or duplicate Firebase queries
5. **Reliable Updates**: Feed now updates immediately when pairings complete

### Technical Impact

- **Code Reduction**: Removed ~200 lines of duplicate listener code from FeedScreen
- **Performance**: Eliminated duplicate Firebase queries and state management
- **Reliability**: Single listener system prevents conflicts and missed updates
- **Maintainability**: Much simpler architecture with clear data flow

### Testing Verification

The fix ensures:
- âœ… Feed updates immediately when pairings complete
- âœ… Real-time updates work consistently across all screens
- âœ… Pull-to-refresh works properly
- âœ… No duplicate or conflicting state management
- âœ… Simplified debugging with single data source

This resolves the feed update issue and creates a much more robust and maintainable real-time system architecture.
